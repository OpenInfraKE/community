# OpenInfra Kenya Community Code of Conduct
The OpenInfra Kenya community aims to be a welcoming place where new and existing members feel safe to respectfully share their ideas, experiences, and perspectives.
We are building a diverse, inclusive environment where contributors from all backgrounds can collaborate, learn, and grow together, united by our shared goal of advancing open infrastructure technologies.
